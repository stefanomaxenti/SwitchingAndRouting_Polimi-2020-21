# Project for the Polimi course "Switching and Routing"

_Developed with [Elisabetta Cainazzo](elisabetta97) and Marco Bottenghi_

This is a SDN implementation, using OpenFlow and RYU as a controller, of a reactive and proactive
link failure detection and restoration system for ring (and not only) networks, tested both on Mininet and on a real testbed made up of Zodiac switches.

The code is provided together with a paper-style [report](https://github.com/stefanomaxenti/SwitchingAndRouting_Polimi-2020-21/blob/main/Report.pdf), [slides](https://github.com/stefanomaxenti/SwitchingAndRouting_Polimi-2020-21/raw/main/Slides.pptx), and demo videos.
